  "description": "When learning a new technology, especially frameworks, beginners often fall in the trap of trying to bit more than they can chew. To learn React, instead of writing one fully-featured application, we propose building several tiny applications that implement simple ideas. The component-based nature of React plays really well with this approach, tiny applications can be as small as a single component or they can later become part of a bigger application. Either way, you'll get tons of practice by being exposed to different problems and patterns.",
